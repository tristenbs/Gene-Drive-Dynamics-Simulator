# Gene-Drive-Dynamics-Simulator
Python simulations that model and predict the impact of gene-drive based techniques on malaria mosquito populations.

According to the CDC, malaria is one of the most severe public health problems worldwide and is the leading cause of death and disease in many developing countries. 
A majority of these deaths are young children and pregnant women.

Using Gene Drives, we can spread genes through mosquito generations that severely decrease female fertility and population. 
Using a system of differential equations, we can put run them in python using ODE solvers to understand the impact of gene drives on mosquito populations over time.
